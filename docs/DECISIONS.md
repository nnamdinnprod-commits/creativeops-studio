# Decision Log

Append-only. One entry per architectural decision, new dependency, or change to a documented
rule. Newest at the bottom.

Keep entries short. The value is the *why* — a future reader (including a future Claude Code
session) needs to know what the alternative was and why it lost.

## 001 — Single-process stack for V1
Date: pre-build (set in CLAUDE.md)
Decision: One Python process serving both API and HTML. No separate frontend dev server.
Alternatives considered: FastAPI + React/Vite (two processes); Next.js full-stack.
Why: The build has a one-day budget and the builder is new to this tooling. A split
frontend/backend costs setup time and CORS debugging that buys nothing a reviewer will see.
Next.js remains the fallback if a public deployed URL becomes a requirement.
Consequences: No client-side routing. Interactivity via HTMX and Alpine. Deployment is
simple but the frontend is less impressive as a standalone artefact.

## 002 — Numbers are computed in Python, never by the model
Date: pre-build (set in AI_WORKFLOWS.md)
Decision: All arithmetic — utilisation, readiness scores, availability, metric comparisons —
is deterministic Python. The model receives computed facts and produces prose and choices.
Alternatives considered: letting the model reason over raw data and return figures.
Why: Reproducible demos, unit-testable logic, and an honest answer to "what if it
hallucinates?" — the wording can vary, the numbers cannot.
Consequences: More Python service code up front. Prompts are longer because facts are passed
in explicitly. Worth it.

## 003 — Recommendations are persisted, not ephemeral
Date: pre-build (set in DATA_MODEL.md)
Decision: A `Recommendation` table holds every AI suggestion with pending/accepted/rejected
state, the rationale, and the computed facts it was based on.
Alternatives considered: generating suggestions on the fly and applying them directly.
Why: "AI recommends, humans decide" is the product's central claim. Persisted state with an
audit trail makes it structurally true rather than a UI label.
Consequences: One extra table and an accept/reject handler per recommendation kind. Also
gives the demo a history view, which strengthens the argument.

## 004 — Phase 1 architecture proposal approved
Date: 2026-08-21
Decision: Approved as proposed — Option A stack; folder structure with `services/capacity.py`
and `services/ai/` as the two enforcement points for the non-negotiables; 7 SQLAlchemy models
matching DATA_MODEL.md exactly; route list covering all 5 screens plus recommendation
accept/reject and localisation actions; template inventory with shared `_ai_badge`,
`_ai_panel_loading`, `_ai_panel_error` partials; 5 AI functions per AI_WORKFLOWS.md.
Alternatives considered: none — Option A was already the documented default, no deviation
proposed.
Why: Nothing in the docs required a different approach; the proposal was a direct
translation of PRODUCT_SPEC.md, DATA_MODEL.md and AI_WORKFLOWS.md into a build order.
Consequences: Proceeding straight to Phase 2 (Skeleton).

## 005 — Implementation-level dependencies added
Date: 2026-08-21
Decision: Added `uvicorn` (runs the app — CLAUDE.md names FastAPI but not its server),
`python-multipart` (FastAPI requires it to parse HTML form POSTs, which every mutating route
uses), `pydantic-settings` and `python-dotenv` (the "one settings object reading from
environment" rule needs a settings library, not hand-rolled `os.environ` parsing).
Alternatives considered: hand-rolled env parsing instead of pydantic-settings.
Why: These are not stack choices, just what FastAPI + the settings rule require to run at
all. Hand-rolling env parsing would violate "no literal config values scattered in code"
just as easily as it would satisfy it.
Consequences: None beyond four extra lines in requirements.txt.

## 006 — Added "Working with the owner" rule to CLAUDE.md
Date: 2026-08-21
Decision: Before each significant step, state in plain language what is about to happen and
why; after each step, state what changed and what can be checked in the browser; flag any
approval that contradicts the docs before acting on it.
Alternatives considered: none — owner-requested addition.
Why: The owner is a Creative Operations professional, not an engineer, and wants intent and
consequence explained, not syntax — and wants to be told, not silently overridden, if an
approval conflicts with what the docs say.
Consequences: Narration becomes part of the working method, not optional colour.

## 007 — requirements.txt uses minimum versions, not exact pins
Date: 2026-08-21
Decision: Changed `requirements.txt` from `==` exact pins to `>=` minimums.
Alternatives considered: keeping exact pins; installing an older Python via Homebrew instead.
Why: This machine's only Python 3.11+ interpreter is 3.14 (the system `/usr/bin/python3` is
3.9, too old for the stack). The exact versions originally pinned predate Python 3.14 and
have no pre-built package for it, so pip tried to compile `pydantic-core` from Rust source
and failed — the build toolchain didn't support 3.14 either. Letting pip resolve current
versions picked up releases that do ship 3.14 wheels, which installed cleanly. Installing an
older Python was the other option but is a bigger, less reversible change to the machine for
a one-day build.
Consequences: No exact version pins for this project — a `pip freeze` after install would
give a reproducible lockfile if that's ever wanted, but isn't needed for a single-day,
single-machine build.

## 008 — Added openai and anthropic SDKs for live AI calls
Date: 2026-08-21
Decision: Added `openai` and `anthropic` to requirements.txt, imported only in
`app/services/ai/client.py` per the rule that no other file imports a provider SDK.
Alternatives considered: skipping live-provider support and shipping mock-only.
Why: AI_WORKFLOWS.md requires `AI_PROVIDER` to support `openai` / `anthropic` / `mock`, and
Phase 4's exit criteria asks that `analyse_brief` work against a live provider if a key is
set. Both installed cleanly on this machine's Python 3.14 environment.
Consequences: Two more dependencies; untested against a live key in this session since none
was provided — the app still runs and is fully tested in mock mode regardless.

## 009 — Localisation risk rule built in Phase 4, not Phase 5
Date: 2026-08-21
Decision: Wrote `app/services/localisation_risk.py` (the deterministic at-risk rule) during
Phase 4 instead of waiting for Phase 5, and used it to feed the Phase 4 dashboard attention
panel.
Alternatives considered: leaving the dashboard's localisation-caused attention item out until
Phase 5.
Why: PRODUCT_SPEC.md's own example attention panel includes a localisation-blocked item, and
BUILD_PLAN.md already named this exact file in the Phase 1 folder structure — it wasn't new
scope, just built slightly earlier than scheduled because Phase 4 genuinely needed it.
Consequences: Phase 5 reuses this function rather than duplicating it; Phase 5's own scope
shrinks to wiring it onto pipeline cards and the localisation status ladder.

## 010 — Seed brief text adjusted; noted a cross-doc scoring inconsistency
Date: 2026-08-21
Decision: Added "DE" to the seeded vague-brief project's text so the rubric scores it at
exactly 50%, and left DEMO_DATA.md's stated "55–70 band" target unmet rather than forcing it.
Alternatives considered: tuning the extraction heuristic or rubric weights until the score
landed in 55–70.
Why: AI_WORKFLOWS.md's rubric weights make 55–70 mathematically unreachable for a brief
missing exactly the four fields DEMO_DATA.md names as gaps (format specs, audience, approval
owner, deadline) — those four sum to exactly 50 of the 100 points, so the ceiling is 50%, not
55-70. This is an inconsistency between the two docs, not something fixable in code without
either contradicting the published rubric or inventing facts the brief text doesn't contain.
Consequences: The seeded vague brief now scores 50% — still well below the 70% threshold, so
it demonstrates the readiness-gate behavior correctly. Owner has been told; docs not silently
edited to match.

## 011 — Centralised Jinja2Templates into app/templates_env.py
Date: 2026-08-21
Decision: Replaced five separate `Jinja2Templates(directory="app/templates")` instances (one
per route file) with a single shared instance, with `settings` registered as a Jinja global.
Alternatives considered: passing `settings` into every individual TemplateResponse call.
Why: AI_WORKFLOWS.md requires a mode indicator ("mock"/"openai"/"anthropic") in the footer on
every screen. A per-file template instance meant a Jinja global set on one didn't reach the
others; centralizing was the only way to guarantee it everywhere without repeating it in six
route handlers.
Consequences: One shared template environment for the whole app — also means any future
global (e.g. current user) only needs to be added once.
